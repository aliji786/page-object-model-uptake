# page-object-model-uptake

# Per the following requirement that were provided to me:
'''
Please make a page object model for the Uptake home page (www.uptake.com) and at least one other page on the site, 
and write a test which verifies that navigation between those pages works correctly. 
You can decide the details like which pages to use and how to verify that they are correct. 
Please send it to me using Github, and I'll forward it to Uptake. 
'''

# The test cases can be executed by running the python file:   testPages.py  which includes the example of some tests written in seperate functions
